			"question": "What is a cube root?",
			"answer": "A cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. For example, the cube root of 8 is 2 because 2 × 2 × 2 = 8."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I calculate the cube root of negative numbers?",
			"answer": "Yes! Unlike square roots, cube roots can be calculated for negative numbers. For example, the cube root of -27 is -3 because (-3) × (-3) × (-3) = -27."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the cube root of 0?",
			"answer": "The cube root of 0 is 0, because 0 × 0 × 0 = 0."
		},
		{
			"question": "How is this different from square root?",
			"answer": "Square root finds a number that when squared (multiplied by itself once) equals the original number. Cube root finds a number that when cubed (multiplied by itself twice) equals the original number."
