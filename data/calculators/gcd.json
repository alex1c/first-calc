	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "What is GCD?",
			"answer": "GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. Also known as GCF (Greatest Common Factor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor)."
		},
		{
			"question": "How is GCD calculated?",
			"answer": "GCD is typically calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly applies the property that GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b) until the remainder is 0."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if the GCD is 1?",
			"answer": "If GCD of two numbers is 1, they are called coprime or relatively prime. This means they have no common factors other than 1."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I find GCD of more than two numbers?",
			"answer": "Yes, you can find GCD of multiple numbers by finding GCD of the first two, then GCD of that result with the third number, and so on."
