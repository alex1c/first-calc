	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "What is inflation adjustment?",
			"answer": "Inflation adjustment converts a monetary value from one time period to another, accounting for the decrease in purchasing power due to inflation. It shows what an amount from the past would be worth in today's dollars."
		},
		{
			"question": "How is inflation calculated?",
			"answer": "Inflation is calculated using compound interest formula: Adjusted Amount = Original Amount × (1 + inflation rate)^years. This accounts for inflation compounding over multiple years."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a typical inflation rate?",
			"answer": "In developed countries, a typical annual inflation rate is around 2-3%. However, inflation rates vary by country and economic conditions. You can use historical data or current economic forecasts."
		},
		{
			"question": "Why adjust for inflation?",
			"answer": "Inflation adjustment helps compare the real purchasing power of money across different time periods. It's essential for financial planning, historical analysis, and understanding the true value of investments or salaries."
