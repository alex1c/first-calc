		{
			"question": "What is LCM?",
			"answer": "LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more numbers. It's useful for finding common denominators in fractions and solving various mathematical problems."
		},
		{
			"question": "How is LCM calculated?",
			"answer": "LCM can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a × b| / GCD(a, b), where GCD is the Greatest Common Divisor. This calculator uses this efficient method."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's the relationship between GCD and LCM?",
			"answer": "For any two numbers a and b: GCD(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = |a × b|. This relationship allows efficient calculation of one when you know the other."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I find LCM of more than two numbers?",
			"answer": "Yes, you can find LCM of multiple numbers by finding LCM of the first two, then LCM of that result with the third number, and so on."
		},
		{
			"question": "When is LCM used?",
			"answer": "LCM is commonly used when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, finding common periods in repeating patterns, and solving problems involving multiples."
