		{
			"question": "What is a logarithm?",
			"answer": "A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. It answers the question: 'To what power must the base be raised to get this number?' For example, log₁₀(100) = 2 because 10² = 100."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a common logarithm?",
			"answer": "A common logarithm uses base 10. It's written as log₁₀(x) or simply log(x). It's commonly used in science and engineering."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a natural logarithm?",
			"answer": "A natural logarithm uses base e (approximately 2.71828). It's written as ln(x) or logₑ(x). Natural logarithms are widely used in mathematics and science."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I use any base?",
			"answer": "Yes, you can use any positive number (except 1) as the base. Common bases include 10 (common logarithm), e (natural logarithm), and 2 (binary logarithm)."
		},
		{
			"question": "Why can't I use 0 or negative numbers?",
			"answer": "Logarithms are only defined for positive numbers. The base must also be positive and not equal to 1."
