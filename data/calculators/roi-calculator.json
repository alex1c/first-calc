		{
			"question": "What is ROI?",
			"answer": "ROI (Return on Investment) is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of an investment. It's expressed as a percentage and shows how much profit or loss you've made relative to your initial investment."
		},
		{
			"question": "How is ROI calculated?",
			"answer": "ROI is calculated using the formula: ROI = ((Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment) × 100%. A positive ROI indicates profit, while negative ROI indicates a loss."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a good ROI?",
			"answer": "A good ROI depends on the type of investment and risk level. Generally, 7-10% annual ROI is considered good for long-term investments. Higher returns often come with higher risks."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can ROI be negative?",
			"answer": "Yes, ROI can be negative when the final value is less than the initial investment, indicating a loss. This is common in investments that don't perform well."
		},
		{
			"question": "Does ROI account for time?",
			"answer": "Basic ROI doesn't account for the time period. For time-weighted returns, you might want to calculate annualized ROI or use other metrics like CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)."
