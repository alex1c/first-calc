			"question": "What is a square root?",
			"answer": "A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 16 is 4 because 4 × 4 = 16."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I calculate the square root of negative numbers?",
			"answer": "No, the square root of a negative number is not a real number. In mathematics, this is represented as an imaginary number, but this calculator only works with real numbers (non-negative values)."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the square root of 0?",
			"answer": "The square root of 0 is 0, because 0 × 0 = 0."
		},
		{
			"question": "How accurate are the results?",
			"answer": "The calculator uses JavaScript's Math.sqrt() function, which provides high precision results for most practical purposes."
