  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Copper vs aluminum?",
      "answer": "Copper and aluminum cables differ in: Conductivity: Copper has better conductivity (~60% better), so smaller cross-section for same current. Weight: Aluminum is lighter (~30% lighter). Cost: Aluminum is less expensive. Sizing: Aluminum typically requires one size larger than copper for the same current. Application: Copper is standard for most applications, aluminum is common for large installations. This calculator adjusts for aluminum by recommending larger sizes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why cable size matters?",
      "answer": "Cable size is critical for: Safety: Undersized cables can overheat, causing fires. Efficiency: Proper sizing minimizes voltage drop and power loss. Code compliance: Electrical codes specify minimum cable sizes. Performance: Correct sizing ensures equipment operates properly. Cost: Oversized cables waste money, undersized cables are dangerous. Always use the correct cable size for your application - this calculator provides estimates, but actual sizing must comply with local codes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if cable is too small?",
      "answer": "Using undersized cable can cause: Overheating: Cable may exceed safe temperature, causing insulation damage. Fire risk: Overheating can lead to electrical fires. Voltage drop: Excessive voltage drop affects equipment performance. Code violations: Undersized cables violate electrical codes. Equipment damage: Insufficient current capacity can damage equipment. Always use cables that meet or exceed calculated requirements. This calculator provides minimum recommendations - consider safety margins and local code requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Single-phase vs three-phase?",
      "answer": "Single-phase and three-phase systems differ in: Current calculation: Single-phase: I = P / V. Three-phase: I = P / (√3 × V) - lower current for same power. Applications: Single-phase for residential, three-phase for commercial/industrial. Efficiency: Three-phase is more efficient for higher power loads. Cable sizing: Three-phase typically requires smaller cables for the same power due to lower current. This calculator handles both - select the appropriate phase type for your system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this calculator exact?",
      "answer": "No, this calculator provides simplified estimates based on: Current calculation (mathematically correct), simplified cable size lookup tables (typical practice), and basic material adjustments. Actual cable sizing depends on: Installation method (affects current capacity), ambient temperature (higher temp = lower capacity), cable length (voltage drop considerations), local electrical codes (may specify different requirements), and safety factors. Always consult qualified electricians and local codes for actual cable sizing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about voltage drop?",
      "answer": "Voltage drop is not calculated in this simplified tool. Voltage drop depends on: Cable length (longer = more drop), cable resistance (smaller cross-section = more drop), and current (higher = more drop). For long cable runs, voltage drop may require larger cable sizes than current capacity alone. This calculator focuses on current capacity - for long runs, consult voltage drop calculations or qualified electricians."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about AWG wire gauge?",
      "answer": "This calculator uses metric cross-section (mm²). North American systems often use AWG (American Wire Gauge). Common conversions: 14 AWG ≈ 2.1 mm², 12 AWG ≈ 3.3 mm², 10 AWG ≈ 5.3 mm², 8 AWG ≈ 8.4 mm², 6 AWG ≈ 13.3 mm². For AWG systems, use conversion tables or consult local codes. This calculator provides mm² for international use - convert to AWG if needed for your region."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about circuit breakers?",
      "answer": "Circuit breakers are sized to protect cables, not the other way around. Typical practice: Circuit breaker should be sized to cable capacity (e.g., 2.5 mm² cable → 25 A max → 20 A or 25 A breaker). This calculator provides cable size - select appropriate circuit breaker based on cable capacity and local codes. Circuit breakers protect against overcurrent, so they should match or be slightly below cable capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for DC systems?",
      "answer": "This calculator is designed for AC systems (single-phase and three-phase). For DC systems: Current calculation is simpler: I = P / V (no phase factor), but cable sizing principles are similar. DC systems may have different considerations (polarity, different voltage drop calculations). Use this calculator as a starting point, but verify with DC-specific calculations and codes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about motor loads?",
      "answer": "Motor loads require special considerations: Starting current: Motors draw 5-7× rated current during startup, requiring larger cables or special protection. Power factor: Motors may have power factor < 1, affecting current calculation. This calculator uses apparent power - for motors, actual current may be higher. Always consult motor specifications and local codes for motor circuit sizing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure power?",
      "answer": "Power can be measured or estimated: Direct measurement: Use power meter or clamp meter. Equipment rating: Check nameplate ratings (kW or kVA). Load estimation: Sum up all connected loads. This calculator needs total power in kW - convert from other units if needed (1 kW = 1000 W, 1 kVA ≈ 1 kW for resistive loads). For accurate sizing, use actual measured or calculated power, not estimated."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about cable length?",
      "answer": "Cable length affects: Voltage drop (longer = more drop, may require larger cable), installation method (affects current capacity), and cost (longer = more expensive). This calculator doesn't account for length-based voltage drop. For long runs (>50 m), voltage drop may require larger cables than current capacity alone. Consult voltage drop calculations or qualified electricians for long cable runs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this code-compliant?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides estimates based on simplified calculations and typical practice. Code compliance depends on: Local electrical codes (IEC, NEC, etc. - varies by region), installation method (affects current capacity tables), and specific code requirements. This calculator is NOT a code compliance tool - always consult local electrical codes, qualified electricians, and proper design standards for code-compliant cable sizing. This is an estimation tool for planning only."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about temperature ratings?",
      "answer": "Cable temperature ratings affect current capacity: Higher temperature rating = higher current capacity (for same cross-section), ambient temperature affects capacity (hotter = lower capacity), and installation method affects heat dissipation. This calculator uses typical temperature ratings - actual capacity may vary. For high-temperature applications or extreme conditions, consult cable specifications and qualified electricians."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for underground cables?",
      "answer": "Yes, but underground installation has special considerations: Different current capacity tables (underground may have different ratings), burial depth and soil conditions affect heat dissipation, and protection requirements (mechanical protection, moisture protection). This calculator provides basic estimates - select 'Underground' installation type for reference, but always consult underground cable specifications and local codes for actual sizing."
