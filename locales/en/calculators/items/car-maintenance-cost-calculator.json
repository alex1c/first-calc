	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "How much does car maintenance cost?",
			"answer": "Maintenance costs vary widely by vehicle type, age, and mileage. Economy cars: $500-1,500/year. Mid-range cars: $1,000-2,500/year. Premium/luxury cars: $2,000-5,000+/year. Older vehicles and high-mileage drivers typically have higher costs. This calculator helps you estimate based on your specific situation."
		},
		{
			"question": "How does age affect maintenance costs?",
			"answer": "Older vehicles require more maintenance and repairs. New cars (0-3 years) have minimal unexpected repairs, often covered by warranty. Cars 4-5 years old see slightly increased issues. Cars 6-8 years old have moderate increases. Cars 9+ years old can have 2x or more unexpected repair costs. The calculator applies age multipliers to account for this."
		},
		{
			"question": "Is maintenance cheaper than repairs?",
			"answer": "Yes! Regular maintenance (oil changes, scheduled service) is much cheaper than major repairs. Preventive maintenance helps avoid costly breakdowns. For example, a $50 oil change is far cheaper than a $3,000 engine replacement. Budgeting for routine maintenance helps prevent unexpected large repair bills."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I budget monthly for maintenance?",
			"answer": "Yes, budgeting monthly for maintenance is wise. Set aside money each month (even if you don't need service that month) so you have funds available when maintenance is due. This prevents financial stress and ensures you can maintain your vehicle properly. The calculator shows your monthly maintenance cost."
		},
		{
			"question": "Does this include tires?",
			"answer": "Yes, tire costs are included in the 'Tire Service Annual' field. This covers tire rotation, balancing, alignment, and tire replacements. Tire costs vary based on vehicle type and driving habits. Premium vehicles often have more expensive tires."
		},
		{
			"question": "How often should I change my oil?",
			"answer": "Oil change frequency depends on your vehicle and oil type. Traditional recommendation: every 3,000-5,000 miles. Modern synthetic oils: every 5,000-10,000 miles. Check your owner's manual for manufacturer recommendations. High-mileage or severe driving conditions may require more frequent changes."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's included in scheduled service?",
			"answer": "Scheduled service typically includes: inspections, fluid changes (coolant, transmission, brake fluid), filter replacements (air, cabin, fuel), belt and hose inspections, battery checks, and other manufacturer-recommended maintenance. Follow your owner's manual schedule for your specific vehicle."
		},
		{
			"question": "How do I estimate unexpected repairs?",
			"answer": "Unexpected repairs are hard to predict but essential to budget for. Use historical data: if your car typically needs $600/year in unexpected repairs, budget that. Older cars need more. The calculator applies age multipliers to help estimate. It's better to overestimate than be caught unprepared."
		},
		{
			"question": "Does maintenance cost more for luxury cars?",
			"answer": "Yes, luxury and premium cars typically have higher maintenance costs. Parts are more expensive, service requires specialized knowledge, and scheduled maintenance is often more frequent. Premium cars may cost 2-3x more to maintain than economy cars. Use the Premium Car preset to see typical costs."
		},
		{
			"question": "How does mileage affect maintenance?",
			"answer": "Higher mileage increases maintenance frequency and costs. More miles mean: more frequent oil changes, more tire wear, more brake pad replacements, more scheduled services, and higher likelihood of unexpected repairs. The calculator accounts for this in your annual costs."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I skip maintenance to save money?",
			"answer": "No! Skipping maintenance is a false economy. Regular maintenance prevents costly breakdowns and extends vehicle life. A $100 service can prevent a $2,000 repair. Well-maintained cars also have better resale value. Budget for maintenance - it's an essential cost of car ownership."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's the difference between routine and unexpected maintenance?",
			"answer": "Routine maintenance is planned, predictable service: oil changes, tire rotation, scheduled inspections. Unexpected repairs are unplanned issues: engine problems, transmission issues, electrical problems, etc. Both are important to budget for, but unexpected repairs are harder to predict."
		},
		{
			"question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
			"answer": "The calculator provides estimates based on typical maintenance costs and patterns. Actual costs vary by: specific vehicle make/model, local labor rates, your driving habits, maintenance history, and luck. Use it as a planning tool and adjust based on your actual experience. It's better to overestimate than underestimate."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I reduce maintenance costs?",
			"answer": "Some ways to reduce costs: do basic maintenance yourself (oil changes, air filters), shop around for service, use quality parts (cheap parts fail faster), follow maintenance schedules (prevents major issues), and choose reliable vehicles with lower maintenance requirements. However, some maintenance is unavoidable."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if I drive very little?",
			"answer": "Low mileage reduces some maintenance (fewer oil changes, less tire wear), but don't skip time-based maintenance. Fluids degrade over time, not just mileage. Follow both mileage and time intervals in your owner's manual. The calculator accounts for this in your estimates."
