  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which mix ratio should I use?",
      "answer": "The choice depends on your project requirements: 1:2:4 (standard) is suitable for most general construction, foundations, and slabs. 1:3:6 (lean mix) is for mass concrete, non-structural applications, and cost-sensitive projects. 1:1.5:3 (high strength) is for structural elements requiring higher strength. Always consult local building codes and structural engineers for specific requirements. The standard 1:2:4 mix is the most commonly used for general construction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do different ratios exist?",
      "answer": "Different mix ratios serve different purposes: Higher cement content (1:1.5:3) provides stronger concrete but is more expensive. Standard ratios (1:2:4) balance strength, workability, and cost for general use. Lean mixes (1:3:6) use less cement, reducing cost but providing lower strength suitable for non-structural applications. The ratio affects concrete strength, durability, workability, and cost. Choose based on your project's structural requirements and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change ratios?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use custom ratios, but be careful: Changing ratios affects concrete strength, durability, and workability. Higher cement content increases strength and cost. Lower cement content reduces strength and may not meet structural requirements. Always consult with a structural engineer or follow local building codes when deviating from standard ratios. The calculator supports custom ratios - enter them in the format cement:sand:gravel (e.g., 1:2:3)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does water affect quantities?",
      "answer": "Water is added separately during mixing and doesn't affect the dry material quantities calculated by this calculator. The mix ratio (1:2:4) refers to the dry materials: cement, sand, and gravel. Water is typically added at 0.4-0.6 water-to-cement ratio (40-60% of cement weight) for proper workability. Water content affects workability and strength but doesn't change the material quantities you need to order."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ready-mix vs site mix?",
      "answer": "Ready-mix concrete is delivered pre-mixed from a plant, while site mix is mixed on-site. This calculator is for site mixing where you order materials separately. For ready-mix, you order by volume (cubic meters or yards) and the supplier handles the mix ratio. Site mixing gives you control over the mix ratio and may be more economical for large projects, but requires proper mixing equipment and expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the density values?",
      "answer": "The calculator uses standard construction densities: Cement: 1440 kg/m³, Sand: 1600 kg/m³, Gravel: 1500 kg/m³. These are widely accepted standard values used in construction calculations. Actual densities may vary slightly (5-10%) depending on material type, moisture content, and compaction, but the standard values provide accurate estimates for material ordering and cost estimation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I use different bag sizes?",
      "answer": "You can adjust the cement bag weight in the calculator. Common bag sizes: 25 kg, 40 kg, 50 kg (most common), and 94 lb (US). The calculator will automatically recalculate the number of bags based on your specified bag weight. Always check what bag sizes are available at your local supplier and adjust accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure concrete volume?",
      "answer": "Measure the dimensions (length × width × height) of the concrete structure. For slabs: length × width × thickness. For footings: length × width × height. For columns: π × radius² × height. Use the Concrete Volume Calculator if you need help calculating volumes for different shapes. Always add a small margin (5-10%) for formwork variations and spillage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about reinforcement (rebar)?",
      "answer": "Reinforcement (rebar) is calculated separately and doesn't affect the concrete material quantities. Rebar displaces a small amount of concrete (typically less than 1-2%), which is usually covered by the waste margin. This calculator focuses on concrete materials (cement, sand, gravel) only. Rebar quantities are calculated based on structural design requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for different concrete strengths?",
      "answer": "Mix ratios are related to concrete strength, but strength also depends on cement type, water-cement ratio, curing, and aggregate quality. Generally: 1:1.5:3 provides higher strength (M25-M30), 1:2:4 provides standard strength (M15-M20), and 1:3:6 provides lower strength (M10-M15). For specific strength requirements, consult with a structural engineer who can specify the exact mix design."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between M15, M20, M25 concrete?",
      "answer": "M15, M20, M25 refer to concrete strength grades (compressive strength in MPa): M15 = 15 MPa, M20 = 20 MPa, M25 = 25 MPa. These correspond roughly to mix ratios: M15 ≈ 1:2:4, M20 ≈ 1:1.5:3, M25 ≈ 1:1:2. However, actual strength depends on many factors beyond just the ratio. This calculator helps with material quantities, but strength specification should come from structural design."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert cubic feet to cubic meters?",
      "answer": "1 cubic meter = 35.3147 cubic feet, or 1 cubic foot = 0.0283168 cubic meters. The calculator automatically handles this conversion when you select the unit. For example, 100 ft³ = 2.83 m³. Most construction projects use cubic meters (metric) or cubic yards (imperial: 1 yd³ = 27 ft³ = 0.7646 m³)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about admixtures?",
      "answer": "Admixtures (plasticizers, accelerators, retarders) are added in small quantities (typically 0.5-2% of cement weight) and don't significantly affect the material quantities calculated by this calculator. Admixtures improve workability, set time, or other properties but don't change the basic mix ratio. This calculator focuses on the main materials: cement, sand, and gravel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I order extra materials?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's highly recommended to add 5-10% extra materials (waste margin) to account for spillage, handling losses, mixing variations, and to ensure you have enough material. Some contractors add up to 15% for complex projects. It's better to have a small amount left over than to run short during construction, which can delay the project and may result in inconsistent concrete batches."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I mix the concrete?",
      "answer": "Concrete mixing requires proper equipment and technique: Use a concrete mixer for consistent results. Add water gradually while mixing. Mix for at least 2-3 minutes until uniform. The water-cement ratio should be 0.4-0.6 (40-60% of cement weight). This calculator provides material quantities - proper mixing technique is essential for quality concrete. Consider using ready-mix for large projects if you don't have mixing equipment."
