  "longDescription": "Our Daily Calorie Needs Calculator (TDEE Calculator) helps you determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure — the number of calories you burn per day including all activities. Simply enter your age, height, weight, sex, and activity level, and the calculator will compute your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), multiply it by your activity level to get your TDEE, and provide calorie targets for weight maintenance, loss, or gain. Understanding your TDEE is essential for effective weight management, whether your goal is to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain your current weight.",

  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is TDEE?",
      "answer": "TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories your body burns per day, including your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) plus calories burned from all activities, exercise, and daily movement. TDEE = BMR × Activity Level Multiplier. It represents the calories you need to consume to maintain your current weight."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between BMR and TDEE?",
      "answer": "BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the calories your body burns at complete rest — just for basic life functions like breathing and circulation. TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is your BMR multiplied by an activity factor that accounts for all your daily movement and exercise. TDEE is always higher than BMR because it includes activity. For example, if your BMR is 1,500 calories and you're moderately active (1.55x), your TDEE would be 1,500 × 1.55 = 2,325 calories."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which activity level should I choose?",
      "answer": "Choose the activity level that best matches your typical week: Sedentary (1.2x) = little to no exercise, desk job; Lightly Active (1.375x) = light exercise 1-3 days/week; Moderately Active (1.55x) = moderate exercise 3-5 days/week; Very Active (1.725x) = hard exercise 6-7 days/week; Athlete (1.9x) = very hard exercise, physical job, or training twice/day. Be honest — overestimating activity leads to overeating."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many calories should I eat to lose weight?",
      "answer": "To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your TDEE. A safe and sustainable deficit is typically 250-500 calories per day, which can lead to 0.25-0.5 kg (0.5-1 lb) of weight loss per week. For example, if your TDEE is 2,000 calories, eating 1,500-1,750 calories per day would create a moderate deficit. Avoid deficits greater than 500-750 calories per day, as they may lead to muscle loss and metabolic slowdown."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a safe calorie deficit?",
      "answer": "A safe calorie deficit is typically 250-500 calories per day, which results in 0.25-0.5 kg (0.5-1 lb) of weight loss per week. This moderate deficit allows for sustainable weight loss while preserving muscle mass and energy levels. Deficits greater than 500-750 calories per day may be too aggressive and can lead to muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, nutritional deficiencies, and difficulty maintaining the diet long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many calories should I eat to gain weight?",
      "answer": "To gain weight (especially muscle), you need to consume more calories than your TDEE. A moderate surplus is typically 250-500 calories per day, which can lead to 0.25-0.5 kg (0.5-1 lb) of weight gain per week. For muscle gain, combine the calorie surplus with resistance training. For example, if your TDEE is 2,000 calories, eating 2,250-2,500 calories per day would create a moderate surplus."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do my results differ from other calorie calculators or apps?",
      "answer": "Different calculators may use different formulas (Mifflin-St Jeor vs Harris-Benedict), different activity level definitions, or different assumptions about calorie deficits. This calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor formula, which is considered the most accurate for modern populations. Small differences (100-200 calories) are normal and expected. Use the results as a starting point and adjust based on your actual results over 2-3 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my metabolism change over time?",
      "answer": "Yes, metabolism can change due to several factors: Age (metabolism generally decreases with age), muscle mass (more muscle = higher metabolism), weight loss (metabolism may slow down as you lose weight, known as metabolic adaptation), medical conditions, medications, and lifestyle changes. It's a good idea to recalculate your TDEE every few months or when your weight or activity level changes significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I eat below my BMR to lose weight faster?",
      "answer": "Eating below your BMR for extended periods is not recommended. BMR represents the minimum calories needed for basic bodily functions. Consistently eating below BMR can slow your metabolism, cause muscle loss, lead to nutritional deficiencies, reduce energy levels, and make it difficult to maintain the diet long-term. Instead, eat below your TDEE (which is higher than BMR) to create a safe calorie deficit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides reasonable estimates for most people, typically within 10-15% of actual TDEE. However, individual variations exist due to genetics, body composition (muscle vs fat), medical conditions, medications, and other factors. Use the results as a starting point and adjust based on your actual results. If you're not seeing expected results after 2-3 weeks, adjust your calorie intake by 100-200 calories and monitor again."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I track calories every day?",
      "answer": "Daily tracking can be helpful, especially when starting, but it's not necessary forever. Many people find success with flexible tracking (tracking most days but not obsessing), focusing on portion sizes and food quality, or using meal planning. The key is finding a sustainable approach that helps you meet your calorie goals without causing stress or disordered eating patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not losing weight even with a calorie deficit?",
      "answer": "If you're not losing weight despite a calorie deficit, consider: 1) You may be underestimating calorie intake (track more accurately), 2) You may be overestimating activity level, 3) Water retention can mask fat loss (weigh yourself at the same time daily), 4) Metabolic adaptation may have occurred, 5) Medical conditions or medications may affect metabolism. Give it 2-3 weeks, then adjust. If issues persist, consult a healthcare provider or registered dietitian."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to recalculate if I lose weight?",
      "answer": "Yes, you should recalculate your TDEE as you lose weight. As your weight decreases, your BMR decreases (smaller body = fewer calories needed), which means your TDEE also decreases. For example, if you lose 10 kg, your maintenance calories will be lower. Recalculate every 5-10 kg of weight change, or every few months, to ensure you're still eating the right amount for your current body size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this calculator if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?",
      "answer": "This calculator is not designed for pregnancy or breastfeeding, as calorie needs during these periods are significantly different and require specialized guidance. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have increased calorie needs that vary by trimester, pre-pregnancy weight, and individual factors. Consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian for personalized calorie recommendations during pregnancy and breastfeeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about cheat days or refeed days?",
      "answer": "Occasional higher-calorie days (cheat days or refeed days) can be part of a sustainable diet plan, especially for long-term weight management. A single high-calorie day won't derail progress if you're consistent the rest of the week. Some people find that planned refeed days (eating at or slightly above maintenance) can help with adherence and may provide metabolic benefits. However, frequent cheat days can slow progress, so moderation is key."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my activity level is correct?",
      "answer": "Monitor your results over 2-3 weeks. If you're maintaining weight while eating at your calculated TDEE, your activity level is likely correct. If you're gaining weight, you may have overestimated your activity level. If you're losing weight (and that's not your goal), you may have underestimated it. Adjust your activity level selection and recalculate. Remember that activity level includes both exercise and daily movement (walking, standing, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between losing 0.25 kg/week and 0.5 kg/week?",
      "answer": "Losing 0.25 kg/week requires a 250-calorie daily deficit, while losing 0.5 kg/week requires a 500-calorie daily deficit. The 0.25 kg/week option is more gradual and may be easier to maintain long-term, with less risk of muscle loss. The 0.5 kg/week option is faster but requires a larger deficit, which may be more challenging to sustain. Choose based on your timeline, preferences, and ability to maintain the deficit. Many people find 0.25-0.5 kg/week to be a good balance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I eat the same calories every day?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Some people prefer consistent daily calories, while others use calorie cycling (eating more on active days, less on rest days). Both approaches can work. The key is that your weekly average matches your goal. For example, if your target is 2,000 calories/day, you could eat 1,800 on Monday, 2,200 on Tuesday, 2,000 on Wednesday, etc., as long as the weekly average is 14,000 calories (2,000 × 7). Find what works best for your lifestyle and preferences."
