  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How are days counted?",
      "answer": "Days are counted by calculating the difference between the start date and end date. By default, the end date is excluded (exclusive counting). For example, between March 1 and March 3, there are 2 days (March 1 and March 2). If you choose to include the end date (inclusive counting), the same period would be 3 days (March 1, March 2, and March 3)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include the end date or not?",
      "answer": "It depends on what you're calculating. For vacation days, rental periods, or any duration where both dates are part of the period, use inclusive counting (include end date). For calculating time elapsed or days until an event, exclusive counting (don't include end date) is typically used. The calculator shows both options so you can choose what makes sense for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do leap years affect the calculation?",
      "answer": "Leap years are automatically handled by the calculator. February 29 in a leap year is counted as a full day. The calculator uses the actual calendar dates, so leap years don't cause any issues with the calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this calculate business days or calendar days?",
      "answer": "This calculator counts calendar days, which includes weekends and holidays. If you need to calculate business days (excluding weekends and holidays), you would need a specialized business days calculator."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many weeks are between the dates?",
      "answer": "The calculator shows both the total days and a breakdown in weeks and remaining days. For example, 15 days equals 2 weeks and 1 day. This helps you understand the duration in both days and weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate days between dates in the past?",
      "answer": "Yes! The calculator works with any valid dates, whether they're in the past, present, or future. You can calculate the number of days between any two dates on the calendar."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the start date is after the end date?",
      "answer": "The calculator requires the start date to be before or equal to the end date. If you enter dates in the wrong order, you'll receive an error message asking you to correct the dates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the calculation?",
      "answer": "The calculation is very accurate, accounting for leap years, varying month lengths, and day boundaries. It uses the exact number of days between the two dates to ensure precision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the calculator account for time zones?",
      "answer": "The calculator uses dates only (not times), so time zones don't affect the calculation. It calculates days based on calendar dates, which is the standard way to measure date differences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What format should I use for dates?",
      "answer": "Use the YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-03-15 for March 15, 2024). The date picker will help you select the correct date format automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate the same day?",
      "answer": "Yes! If you enter the same date for both start and end, the result will be 0 days (exclusive) or 1 day (inclusive). This represents a single day period."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate days until a future event?",
      "answer": "Enter today's date as the start date and the event date as the end date. Use exclusive counting (don't include end date) to see how many days remain until the event. For example, if today is March 1 and the event is March 10, you have 9 days remaining."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between exclusive and inclusive counting?",
      "answer": "Exclusive counting excludes the end date from the total. Inclusive counting includes the end date. For example, between March 1 and March 5: exclusive = 4 days (March 1-4), inclusive = 5 days (March 1-5). Choose based on whether the end date is part of the period you're measuring."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for calculating rental periods?",
      "answer": "Yes! For rental periods, you typically want to include both the start and end dates, so use inclusive counting. This ensures you count all days you're paying for, including both the first and last day of the rental period."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the calculator handle month boundaries?",
      "answer": "The calculator correctly handles transitions between months and years. It counts the actual calendar days, so moving from the end of one month to the beginning of the next is handled automatically. For example, from January 31 to February 5 correctly accounts for the different month lengths."
