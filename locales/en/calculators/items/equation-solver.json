  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is a linear equation?",
      "answer": "A linear equation is an equation of the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0. It has exactly one solution: x = -b/a. Examples include 2x + 5 = 15 and 3x - 7 = 14."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a quadratic equation?",
      "answer": "A quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. It can have zero, one, or two real solutions depending on the discriminant D = b² - 4ac."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the discriminant?",
      "answer": "The discriminant (D) is the expression b² - 4ac in a quadratic equation. It determines the nature of the roots: if D > 0, there are two distinct real roots; if D = 0, there is one real root (repeated); if D < 0, there are no real roots (complex roots exist)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does a linear equation have 'no solutions' or 'infinite solutions'?",
      "answer": "If a linear equation simplifies to 0 = 0 (e.g., 0x + 0 = 0), it's always true, so there are infinite solutions. If it simplifies to a non-zero constant = 0 (e.g., 5 = 0), it's never true, so there are no solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'no real roots' mean for quadratic equations?",
      "answer": "When the discriminant is negative (D < 0), the quadratic equation has no real roots. However, it does have two complex roots involving the imaginary unit i (√-1). The calculator shows 'no real roots' to indicate that real number solutions don't exist."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I enter spaces in the equation?",
      "answer": "Yes, spaces are optional. The parser will handle equations with or without spaces. For example, '2x+5=15' and '2x + 5 = 15' are both valid."
    },
    {
      "question": "What formats are supported for entering equations?",
      "answer": "For linear equations: 'ax + b = c' or 'ax + b = dx + e'. For quadratic: 'ax^2 + bx + c = 0', 'x^2 + 5x = 0', or 'x^2 - 4 = 0'. You can use x^2 or x² for quadratic terms. Missing terms are allowed (e.g., 'x^2 + 5x = 0' where c = 0)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the solutions?",
      "answer": "Solutions are calculated with high precision and displayed with 6 decimal places. The calculations are mathematically exact for the given inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I solve equations with fractions?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can enter fractional coefficients as decimals. For example, for (1/2)x + 3 = 0, enter '0.5x + 3 = 0' or use coefficient mode with a = 0.5, b = 3."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I enter an invalid equation format?",
      "answer": "The parser will show an error message with examples of valid formats. Make sure your equation contains exactly one '=' sign and follows the supported formats for linear or quadratic equations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use coefficient mode?",
      "answer": "Select 'Enter coefficients' mode, choose the equation type (Linear or Quadratic), and enter the coefficient values directly. For linear: enter a and b. For quadratic: enter a, b, and c. The equation will be normalized automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between equation mode and coefficient mode?",
      "answer": "Equation mode lets you enter the equation as natural text (e.g., '2x + 5 = 15'), which is more intuitive. Coefficient mode requires you to enter the coefficients directly (a, b, c), which is faster if you already know the coefficients."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I solve systems of equations?",
      "answer": "No, this calculator solves single linear or quadratic equations only. For systems of equations, you would need a different tool that handles multiple equations simultaneously."
