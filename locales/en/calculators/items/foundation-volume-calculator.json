  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How to estimate foundation volume?",
      "answer": "Measure the dimensions of your foundation: For slabs, measure length, width, and thickness. For strip foundations, measure the total length of all strips, width, and height. For pads, measure each pad's dimensions and count them. For piles, measure diameter and depth, then count them. Use this calculator to get accurate volume estimates. Always add 5-10% extra for waste and formwork variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Slab vs strip vs piles?",
      "answer": "Slab foundations are large flat concrete slabs that support the entire building. Strip foundations (continuous footings) run along load-bearing walls. Isolated pad footings support individual columns or posts. Pile foundations are deep cylindrical foundations used in poor soil conditions or for heavy loads. The choice depends on soil conditions, building load, and local building codes. Consult with a structural engineer for the appropriate foundation type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much extra concrete should I order?",
      "answer": "It's recommended to add 5-10% extra concrete (waste margin) to account for formwork variations, spillage, and to ensure you have enough material. For complex foundations or when using site mixing, consider adding 10-15% extra. It's better to have a small amount left over than to run short during pouring, which can cause delays and inconsistent concrete batches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I include footing + slab together?",
      "answer": "It depends on your foundation design: If you have a slab-on-grade (slab directly on ground), calculate only the slab volume. If you have footings with a slab above, calculate them separately and add the volumes together. Some foundations combine strip footings with a slab - calculate each part separately and sum them. This calculator handles each foundation type separately - if you have multiple types, calculate each and add the results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Metric vs cubic yards?",
      "answer": "The calculator supports both metric (cubic meters) and imperial (cubic feet) units. For imperial users, it also provides cubic yards conversion (1 yd³ = 27 ft³ = 0.7646 m³). Most concrete suppliers in the US quote prices in cubic yards, while suppliers elsewhere use cubic meters. The calculator automatically converts between units for your convenience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What thickness should I use for a slab foundation?",
      "answer": "Slab foundation thickness depends on load and soil conditions: Residential slabs: typically 10-15 cm (4-6 inches). Commercial/industrial slabs: 15-25 cm (6-10 inches). Thicker slabs (20-30 cm) may be needed for heavy loads or poor soil. Always check local building codes and consult with a structural engineer for specific requirements. The calculator accepts any thickness value."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure strip foundation length?",
      "answer": "Measure the total length of all strip foundation sections combined. For a rectangular building, this is typically the perimeter (2 × length + 2 × width). For complex layouts, measure each section separately and add them together. Include all continuous footing sections that will be poured together. The calculator multiplies this total length by width and height to get volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate multiple foundation types together?",
      "answer": "This calculator handles one foundation type at a time. If your project has multiple types (e.g., strip footings plus a slab), calculate each type separately using this calculator, then add the volumes together. Don't forget to apply the waste margin to the total combined volume when ordering."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about reinforcement (rebar)?",
      "answer": "Reinforcement (rebar) is calculated separately and doesn't affect the concrete volume calculation. Rebar displaces a small amount of concrete (typically less than 1-2%), which is usually covered by the waste margin. This calculator focuses on concrete volume only. Rebar quantities are calculated based on structural design requirements and spacing specifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "The calculator provides accurate volume estimates based on geometric formulas for each foundation type. Accuracy depends on precise measurement of dimensions. The formulas are mathematically correct, but actual concrete needs may vary slightly due to formwork, surface irregularities, and compaction. Always add a waste margin (5-10%) for real-world projects to account for these variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my foundation has irregular shapes?",
      "answer": "This calculator handles regular geometric shapes (rectangular slabs, strips, pads, and cylindrical piles). For irregular shapes, break them down into regular shapes, calculate each separately, and add the volumes together. For very complex foundations, consider consulting with a structural engineer or using CAD software for accurate volume calculations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ready-mix vs site mix for foundations?",
      "answer": "Ready-mix concrete is delivered pre-mixed from a plant, while site mix is mixed on-site. For foundations, ready-mix is often preferred because: it ensures consistent quality, saves time, and is suitable for large volumes. Site mixing may be more economical for small projects but requires proper mixing equipment and expertise. This calculator helps you estimate volume for either option."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about foundation depth?",
      "answer": "Foundation depth (height/thickness) depends on several factors: soil bearing capacity, frost line depth, building load, and local building codes. Typical depths: Shallow foundations (slabs, strips): 0.3-1.5 meters. Deep foundations (piles): 3-30+ meters depending on soil conditions. Always consult local building codes and a structural engineer for specific depth requirements. The calculator accepts any depth value you provide."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert between units?",
      "answer": "The calculator automatically handles unit conversion: 1 m³ = 35.3147 ft³, or 1 ft³ = 0.0283168 m³. For cubic yards: 1 yd³ = 27 ft³ = 0.7646 m³. Simply select your preferred unit system (meters or feet) and enter dimensions in that unit. The calculator will provide results in both the selected unit and cubic meters (for consistency), plus cubic yards if using imperial units."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about foundation excavation?",
      "answer": "Foundation excavation volume is separate from concrete volume. Excavation removes soil to create space for the foundation, while concrete fills that space. Excavation volume is typically larger than concrete volume due to formwork space and over-excavation. This calculator focuses on concrete volume only. Calculate excavation separately if needed, accounting for formwork and working space around the foundation."
