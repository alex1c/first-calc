	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "What counts as car expenses?",
			"answer": "Car expenses include all costs associated with owning and operating your vehicle: insurance, fuel, maintenance, repairs, loan payments, registration fees, parking, tolls, car washes, and any other vehicle-related costs. This calculator helps you track all of these monthly expenses."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's the difference between fuel and maintenance costs?",
			"answer": "Fuel costs are the money you spend on gasoline or diesel to power your car. Maintenance costs are regular services to keep your car running properly, such as oil changes, tire rotations, brake pad replacements, and scheduled service visits. Repairs are separate and cover unexpected issues like engine problems or transmission failures."
		},
		{
			"question": "Does this calculator include depreciation?",
			"answer": "No, this calculator focuses on monthly cash expenses you actually pay. Depreciation is a non-cash expense that represents the loss in your car's value over time. For a complete picture including depreciation, use our Car Cost of Ownership Calculator."
		},
		{
			"question": "How can I reduce my monthly car costs?",
			"answer": "Several strategies can help: shop around for better insurance rates, drive less to reduce fuel costs, maintain your car well to avoid major repairs, consider refinancing your loan for a lower payment, use public transportation when possible, and eliminate unnecessary expenses like premium car washes or expensive parking."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I include my car loan payment?",
			"answer": "Yes, if you have a car loan, include your monthly payment in the loan payment field. This is a fixed monthly expense that's part of your total car ownership cost. If you own your car outright, enter 0 for the loan payment."
		},
		{
			"question": "How do I calculate monthly registration cost?",
			"answer": "Divide your annual vehicle registration fee by 12. For example, if your annual registration is $240, your monthly cost is $20. Some states have different fee structures, so check your registration documents for the exact annual amount."
		},
		{
			"question": "Which fuel cost method should I use?",
			"answer": "If you know your exact monthly fuel spending, use 'Enter Monthly Fuel Cost'. If you want to calculate it from your driving habits, use 'Calculate from Price & Mileage'. The calculation method is useful for budgeting or comparing different vehicles."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if I don't drive every month?",
			"answer": "Enter your average monthly expenses. If you drive seasonally or have months with no driving, you can calculate an average by adding up your annual expenses and dividing by 12. This gives you a more accurate picture of your typical monthly costs."
		},
		{
			"question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
			"answer": "The calculator is as accurate as the information you provide. Actual costs will vary based on your driving habits, vehicle condition, location, and unexpected expenses. Use it as a budgeting tool and update the values regularly as your expenses change."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's the difference between fixed and variable costs?",
			"answer": "Fixed costs (insurance, loan, parking, registration) stay the same each month regardless of how much you drive. Variable costs (fuel, maintenance, repairs) change based on your driving habits and vehicle condition. Understanding this helps with budgeting."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I include car washes and detailing?",
			"answer": "Yes, include these in 'Other Monthly Costs' if they're regular expenses. However, if they're occasional or optional, you might exclude them to see your essential monthly costs. The calculator is flexible - include what matters for your budgeting needs."
		},
		{
			"question": "How does this differ from the Cost of Ownership Calculator?",
			"answer": "This calculator focuses on monthly cash expenses you pay each month. The Cost of Ownership Calculator looks at total costs over several years, including depreciation. Use this calculator for monthly budgeting and the Cost of Ownership Calculator for long-term planning."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if my repair costs vary greatly each month?",
			"answer": "Enter an average monthly repair cost. You can calculate this by adding up your annual repair expenses and dividing by 12. This smooths out the variability and gives you a better picture of your typical monthly costs."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I use this for multiple vehicles?",
			"answer": "Yes! Run the calculator separately for each vehicle and add the results together to see your total monthly car expenses across all vehicles. This is helpful for households with multiple cars."
		}
