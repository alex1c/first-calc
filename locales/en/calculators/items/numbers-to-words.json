  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How are numbers converted to words?",
      "answer": "Numbers are converted by breaking them down into groups (millions, thousands, hundreds) and converting each group to words. The groups are then combined with appropriate scale words (million, thousand, etc.). For example, 1,234,567 becomes \"one million two hundred thirty-four thousand five hundred sixty-seven\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the limits of conversion?",
      "answer": "The calculator supports numbers up to 999,999,999,999,999 (999 trillion). This covers most practical use cases. Very large numbers beyond this limit may not convert correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are decimal numbers handled?",
      "answer": "Decimal numbers are converted by spelling out the integer part in words, then the decimal digits individually after the word \"point\". For example, 123.45 becomes \"one hundred twenty-three point four five\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is currency mode?",
      "answer": "Currency mode formats numbers as dollars and cents. The integer part becomes dollars, and the decimal part (multiplied by 100) becomes cents. For example, 1234.56 becomes \"one thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars and fifty-six cents\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I write a check amount?",
      "answer": "Use currency mode and enter the dollar amount. The calculator will format it as dollars and cents, which is the standard format for writing checks. For example, $1,234.56 becomes \"one thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars and fifty-six cents\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are negative numbers supported?",
      "answer": "Yes, negative numbers are supported. They are converted with the word \"negative\" before the number. For example, -42 becomes \"negative forty-two\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are large numbers broken down?",
      "answer": "Large numbers are broken down by scale: millions, thousands, and hundreds. Each scale is converted separately and combined. For example, 1,234,567 is broken down as: 1 million, 234 thousand, 567 hundreds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about zero?",
      "answer": "Zero is converted as \"zero\". In currency mode, zero dollars would be \"zero dollars\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I convert very small decimal numbers?",
      "answer": "Yes, the calculator handles decimal numbers of any reasonable precision. Each decimal digit is spelled out individually after \"point\". For example, 0.123 becomes \"zero point one two three\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the conversion?",
      "answer": "The conversion is very accurate and follows standard English number naming conventions. It correctly handles all number scales from ones to trillions, including proper hyphenation and scale word usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What language is supported?",
      "answer": "Currently, the calculator supports English number words. Future versions may support additional languages."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I copy the result?",
      "answer": "The number in words is displayed in a large, copyable format. You can select and copy the text directly from the result display."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for formal documents?",
      "answer": "Yes, the converter follows standard English number naming conventions, making it suitable for formal documents, legal papers, and official writing where numbers need to be written in words."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between standard and currency mode?",
      "answer": "Standard mode converts numbers to words as-is (e.g., \"one thousand two hundred thirty-four\"). Currency mode formats numbers as dollars and cents (e.g., \"one thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars and fifty-six cents\"). Use currency mode for financial documents and checks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are numbers with many decimal places handled?",
      "answer": "All decimal digits are spelled out individually after \"point\". For example, 123.456789 becomes \"one hundred twenty-three point four five six seven eight nine\". There's no limit on decimal precision, though very long decimals may be impractical to read."
