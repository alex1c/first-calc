  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between percent and percentage change?",
      "answer": "Percent is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. Percentage change specifically measures how much a value has increased or decreased relative to its original value. For example, 50% is a percent, while +50% change means the value increased by 50% from its original."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate percentage change?",
      "answer": "Use the formula: ((new - original) / original) × 100%. Subtract the original value from the new value, divide by the original value, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The sign (+ or -) indicates increase or decrease."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use negative values?",
      "answer": "Yes, both original and new values can be negative. The calculator handles negative numbers correctly. For example, going from -20 to -10 is a 50% increase, as the value becomes less negative (closer to zero)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the original value is zero?",
      "answer": "The original value cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. The calculator will show an error if you enter zero as the original value. You need a non-zero starting point to calculate percentage change."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is rounding handled?",
      "answer": "The calculator displays results rounded to 6 decimal places for precision. For most practical purposes, you may want to round to 1-2 decimal places. The formula shows the exact calculation steps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common financial use cases?",
      "answer": "Percentage change is commonly used for: stock price changes, inflation rates, salary increases, sales growth, population changes, interest rate changes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and performance metrics in business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a negative percentage change mean?",
      "answer": "A negative percentage change (e.g., -25%) means the value decreased. The new value is smaller than the original value. For example, -25% means the value decreased by 25% from its original amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a positive percentage change mean?",
      "answer": "A positive percentage change (e.g., +50%) means the value increased. The new value is larger than the original value. For example, +50% means the value increased by 50% from its original amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I interpret percentage change with negative numbers?",
      "answer": "When working with negative numbers, a positive percentage change means the value became less negative (moved closer to zero or became positive). A negative percentage change means the value became more negative (moved further from zero)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the absolute difference?",
      "answer": "The absolute difference is the numerical change between the new and original values (new - original). It shows the actual amount of change, regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease. For example, if original is 100 and new is 120, the absolute difference is 20."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can percentage change exceed 100%?",
      "answer": "Yes, percentage change can exceed 100%. For example, if a value increases from 50 to 150, that's a 200% increase. The value more than doubled. There's no upper limit on percentage change."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if both values are the same?",
      "answer": "If the original and new values are the same, the percentage change is 0% and the direction is 'No Change'. The absolute difference is also zero."
