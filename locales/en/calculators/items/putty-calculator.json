  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Typical putty thickness?",
      "answer": "Typical putty layer thickness ranges from 0.5-2 mm (0.02-0.08 inches). Thin layer (0.5-1 mm): for smooth surfaces, final finishing. Medium layer (1-1.5 mm): for most walls, standard application. Thick layer (1.5-2 mm): for uneven surfaces, leveling. Never apply more than 2-3 mm in a single layer - use multiple thin layers instead for better results."
    },
    {
      "question": "One thick layer or two thin?",
      "answer": "Two thin layers are generally better than one thick layer because: better adhesion (each layer bonds properly), less cracking (thick layers can crack as they dry), smoother finish (easier to sand thin layers), and better control (easier to apply and level). Use 1-1.5 mm per layer, apply 2 layers for best results. One thick layer may be faster but often results in lower quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does surface type matter?",
      "answer": "Yes, surface type significantly affects putty consumption: Smooth surfaces (painted, sealed): lower consumption, even application. Porous surfaces (plaster, drywall): may absorb more putty, slightly higher consumption. Rough surfaces (concrete, brick): much higher consumption due to increased surface area and unevenness. Very uneven walls may require 20-30% more putty than calculated."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much extra should I buy?",
      "answer": "Buy 10-15% extra for smooth surfaces, 20-30% extra for uneven surfaces. Extra putty accounts for: spillage and waste during application, uneven surface variations, touch-ups and repairs, and sanding losses. It's better to have leftover putty than to run out mid-project, which can cause color or texture mismatches if you need to buy more."
    },
    {
      "question": "Putty vs plaster?",
      "answer": "Putty (wall filler) is a fine finishing material for smooth surfaces, typically 0.5-2 mm thick, used for final surface preparation before painting. Plaster is a thicker coating material (5-20 mm), used for leveling walls and creating base layers. Putty is applied after plaster for final smoothness. Use putty for finishing, plaster for leveling. They have different consumption rates and applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is putty consumption rate?",
      "answer": "Putty consumption rate is the amount of putty needed per unit area per unit thickness, typically expressed as kg/m²/mm (kilograms per square meter per millimeter). Standard consumption is 1.2 kg/m²/mm, meaning 1.2 kg of putty is needed for 1 m² of surface with 1 mm thickness. Consumption varies by putty type and surface - check the putty bag label for specific consumption rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure surface area?",
      "answer": "Measure the surface area the same way as for paint: For walls: length × height for each wall, add all walls together. Use the Wall Area Calculator for accurate measurements. Don't subtract windows and doors unless they're very large - the waste margin accounts for cutting in around openings. Measure from your construction drawings for accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What putty bag sizes are common?",
      "answer": "Common putty bag sizes: Metric: 5 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg, 25 kg. Imperial: 11 lbs (5 kg), 22 lbs (10 kg), 44 lbs (20 kg), 55 lbs (25 kg). The calculator assumes 20 kg (44 lbs) bags, which is the most common size. Always check what sizes are available at your local store and adjust accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I apply putty in one thick layer?",
      "answer": "It's not recommended to apply putty in one very thick layer (more than 2-3 mm) because: risk of cracking as it dries, poor adhesion to surface, difficult to sand smooth, and longer drying time. Always use multiple thin layers (1-1.5 mm each) for best results. Allow each layer to dry completely before applying the next."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does putty take to dry?",
      "answer": "Putty drying time varies: Standard putty: 4-6 hours to touch, 24 hours before sanding, 48 hours before painting. Fast-drying putty: 2-3 hours to touch, 12 hours before sanding. Always check the putty bag label for specific drying times. Drying time depends on: layer thickness (thicker = longer), humidity, and temperature. Don't sand or paint until putty is fully dry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to sand putty?",
      "answer": "Yes, sanding is essential after putty application to: smooth the surface, remove imperfections, level the surface, and prepare for painting. Sand with fine-grit sandpaper (120-180 grit) after putty is fully dry. Sand gently to avoid removing too much putty. Vacuum or wipe away dust before painting. Multiple thin layers with sanding between layers provide the best finish."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use putty on exterior walls?",
      "answer": "Yes, but use exterior-grade putty which is: weather-resistant, UV-stable, and moisture-resistant. Exterior putty may have different consumption rates and application requirements. Check the manufacturer's specifications for exterior use. Interior putty should not be used outdoors as it will degrade from weather exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about putty for ceilings?",
      "answer": "Putty for ceilings uses the same calculation method. Ceilings may require: slightly more putty due to overhead application (some waste), careful application to avoid sagging, and proper support during drying. Use the same consumption rates and layer thicknesses. Measure ceiling area (length × width) and calculate normally."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "The calculator provides accurate estimates based on geometric calculations and standard putty consumption rates. Accuracy depends on: precise surface area measurement, correct layer thickness estimation, accurate consumption rate from putty bag, and realistic assessment of surface evenness. The estimate is typically within 10-15% of actual needs when measurements are accurate. Always add a waste margin (10-30%) for real-world projects, especially for uneven surfaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I mix different putty brands?",
      "answer": "It's generally not recommended to mix different putty brands or types in the same layer, as they may have: different drying times, different textures, and different properties. However, you can use different brands for different layers if needed. Always use the same brand and type within a single layer for consistent results. If you need to switch brands, ensure the previous layer is fully dry and sanded."
