  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the hypotenuse?",
      "answer": "The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle. In the Pythagorean theorem formula a² + b² = c², the hypotenuse is represented by c."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does the Pythagorean theorem apply?",
      "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem applies only to right triangles (triangles with one 90-degree angle). It states that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the two legs: a² + b² = c²."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are real-life applications of the Pythagorean theorem?",
      "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem is used in construction (ensuring square corners), navigation (calculating distances), engineering (designing structures), computer graphics (calculating distances), and many other fields where right triangles appear."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find the hypotenuse?",
      "answer": "To find the hypotenuse, you need to know both legs (a and b). Use the formula c = √(a² + b²). Enter both leg lengths in the calculator and select 'Find Hypotenuse' mode."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find a missing leg?",
      "answer": "To find a missing leg, you need to know the hypotenuse (c) and the other leg (a). Use the formula b = √(c² − a²). Enter the hypotenuse and known leg, then select 'Find Missing Leg' mode."
    },
    {
      "question": "What units should I use?",
      "answer": "You can use any unit of length (cm, m, inches, feet, etc.). The result will be in the same units as your input. For example, if you enter dimensions in meters, the result will be in meters."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the calculations?",
      "answer": "The calculator uses standard mathematical formulas with high precision. Results are rounded to 6 decimal places for display. The calculations are mathematically exact for the given inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I enter negative numbers?",
      "answer": "All side lengths must be positive numbers greater than zero. The calculator will validate inputs and show an error if invalid values are entered. Triangle sides cannot be negative or zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why must the hypotenuse be greater than the leg?",
      "answer": "In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always the longest side (opposite the right angle). Therefore, when finding a missing leg, the hypotenuse c must be greater than the known leg a, otherwise the triangle cannot exist."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for non-right triangles?",
      "answer": "No, the Pythagorean theorem applies only to right triangles. For other triangles, you would need different formulas such as the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Pythagorean triples?",
      "answer": "Pythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers (a, b, c) that satisfy a² + b² = c². Common examples include (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (7, 24, 25)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I verify my calculation?",
      "answer": "You can verify by checking if a² + b² = c². For example, if you calculated c=5 from a=3 and b=4, verify: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². The calculator shows the formula with substituted values for easy verification."
