  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the discriminant?",
      "answer": "The discriminant (D) is the expression b² - 4ac in the quadratic formula. It determines the nature of the roots: if D > 0, there are two distinct real roots; if D = 0, there is one real root (repeated); if D < 0, there are no real roots (complex roots exist)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the quadratic formula?",
      "answer": "The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a, which gives the solutions to any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. The ± symbol means there are two solutions: one with + and one with -."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are real vs complex roots?",
      "answer": "Real roots are numbers that can be represented on the number line (like 2, -3, 0.5). Complex roots involve the imaginary unit i (√-1) and cannot be represented as real numbers. When the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has complex roots, not real roots."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are quadratic equations used?",
      "answer": "Quadratic equations appear in many fields: physics (projectile motion, optimization), engineering (design, optimization), economics (profit maximization), geometry (area problems), and computer graphics (curve fitting). They're fundamental in algebra and calculus."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't coefficient a be zero?",
      "answer": "If a = 0, the equation becomes bx + c = 0, which is a linear equation, not a quadratic equation. The quadratic formula requires dividing by 2a, so a cannot be zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean when D = 0?",
      "answer": "When the discriminant D = 0, the quadratic equation has exactly one real root (also called a repeated or double root). This happens when the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point. The root is x = -b / 2a."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can coefficients be negative?",
      "answer": "Yes, all coefficients (a, b, c) can be negative, positive, or zero (except a which must be non-zero). Negative coefficients are common in quadratic equations and are handled correctly by the calculator."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the calculations?",
      "answer": "The calculator uses standard mathematical formulas with high precision. Roots are rounded to 6 decimal places for display. The calculations are mathematically exact for the given inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the equation has no real roots?",
      "answer": "If the discriminant is negative (D < 0), the equation has no real roots. However, it does have two complex roots. The calculator will explain this and show the complex root values in the explanation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I verify the roots?",
      "answer": "To verify a root, substitute it back into the original equation. For example, if x = 2 is a root of x² - 5x + 6 = 0, then 2² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0, confirming it's correct."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the discriminant and the graph?",
      "answer": "The discriminant tells you about the x-intercepts of the parabola y = ax² + bx + c: D > 0 means two x-intercepts, D = 0 means one x-intercept (touching), D < 0 means no x-intercepts (parabola doesn't cross x-axis)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I solve quadratic equations with fractions?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can enter fractional coefficients as decimals. For example, for (1/2)x² + (3/4)x - 1 = 0, enter a = 0.5, b = 0.75, c = -1. The calculator handles decimal inputs correctly."
