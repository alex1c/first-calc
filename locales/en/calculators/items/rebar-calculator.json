  "longDescription": "Our Rebar Calculator helps you estimate rebar quantity for rectangular slab/grid reinforcement. Enter slab dimensions, select rebar diameter, specify spacing and number of layers, and get accurate estimates of bar counts, total rebar length, and weight. Supports standard rebar diameters (6-20 mm) and accounts for edge allowance (cover). Includes optional waste margin calculation (3-15%) to account for overlaps, cuts, and handling. Perfect for contractors, engineers, and construction planning. Get accurate estimates with clear breakdowns showing bars in each direction, per-layer totals, and waste-adjusted quantities. Note: This calculator provides estimates for grid reinforcement only and is not a structural design tool - always consult with a structural engineer for actual design requirements.",

  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How to choose spacing?",
      "answer": "Rebar spacing is determined by structural design requirements based on: slab thickness, load requirements, and local building codes. Common spacing: 150-200 mm for residential slabs, 200-300 mm for light commercial, and as specified by structural engineer for heavy loads. Tighter spacing (150 mm) provides better reinforcement but costs more. Always follow structural design specifications - this calculator estimates quantity based on your spacing input."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does rebar diameter mean?",
      "answer": "Rebar diameter is the thickness of the steel bar, measured in millimeters. Common diameters: 6-8 mm for light reinforcement, 10-12 mm for standard slabs, 14-16 mm for heavy slabs, 18-20 mm for structural beams. Larger diameter bars are stronger but heavier and more expensive. The diameter affects weight per meter - larger diameters weigh more. Typical slab reinforcement uses 10-16 mm diameter bars."
    },
    {
      "question": "1 or 2 layers?",
      "answer": "Number of layers depends on structural requirements: 1 layer (bottom reinforcement): for thin slabs (10-15 cm), light loads, or one-way slabs. 2 layers (top and bottom): for thicker slabs (15+ cm), heavy loads, or two-way slabs. Two-layer reinforcement provides better structural performance and crack control. Always follow structural design specifications - this calculator estimates quantity for your selected number of layers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why edge allowance?",
      "answer": "Edge allowance (also called cover or concrete cover) is the distance from the rebar to the edge of the concrete. It's necessary for: protecting rebar from corrosion, providing fire resistance, ensuring proper bond between concrete and rebar, and meeting building code requirements. Typical cover: 40-50 mm for interior slabs, 50-75 mm for exterior or exposed conditions. The calculator subtracts edge allowance from slab dimensions to calculate effective reinforcement area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is overlap included?",
      "answer": "Overlaps (splices) are not explicitly calculated in the base quantity, but are accounted for in the waste margin. Rebar overlaps are typically 40-50 times the bar diameter (e.g., 480-600 mm for 12 mm bars). The waste margin (typically 5%) accounts for overlaps, cuts, and handling. For precise overlap calculations, consult structural design specifications. This calculator provides estimates - actual overlaps depend on bar lengths available and splice requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why results are estimates?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides estimates because: it assumes uniform grid spacing (actual layouts may vary), it doesn't account for specific structural design requirements, bar lengths may require splices/overlaps, and actual requirements depend on loads, codes, and engineering analysis. This is an estimation tool for planning and budgeting - always consult with a structural engineer for actual rebar design and quantities. The calculator is not a structural design tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about rebar weight per meter?",
      "answer": "Rebar weight per meter varies by diameter: 6 mm: 0.222 kg/m, 8 mm: 0.395 kg/m, 10 mm: 0.617 kg/m, 12 mm: 0.888 kg/m, 14 mm: 1.210 kg/m, 16 mm: 1.580 kg/m, 18 mm: 2.000 kg/m, 20 mm: 2.470 kg/m. These are standard values based on steel density. The calculator uses these values to convert rebar length to weight. Actual weights may vary slightly by manufacturer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for beams or columns?",
      "answer": "This calculator is designed for rectangular slab/grid reinforcement. For beams or columns: rebar layout is different (longitudinal bars + stirrups/ties), calculations are more complex, and structural design is required. Use specialized calculators or consult with a structural engineer for beams and columns. This calculator focuses on the most common case: slab reinforcement grids."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about rebar grade?",
      "answer": "Rebar grade (e.g., Grade 60, Grade 40) affects strength but not weight calculation. This calculator estimates weight and length only - grade selection is a structural design decision. Different grades have the same weight per meter for the same diameter. Always use the rebar grade specified in structural design - this calculator helps estimate quantity, not select grade."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure slab dimensions?",
      "answer": "Measure slab dimensions from your construction drawings or by physically measuring: Measure length and width at the outer edges of the slab. For irregular shapes, break into rectangles, calculate each separately, and add totals together. Always measure the actual slab area where reinforcement will be placed. Use the Slab Foundation Calculator if you need help calculating slab dimensions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about rebar supports (chairs)?",
      "answer": "Rebar supports (chairs, spacers) are calculated separately and are not included in this calculator. Supports are needed to: maintain proper cover (edge allowance), keep rebar in position during concrete pour, and support top reinforcement in two-layer slabs. Calculate supports separately based on spacing and slab area. This calculator focuses on rebar quantity only."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for precast slabs?",
      "answer": "Yes, this calculator works for precast slabs if they use grid reinforcement. However, precast slabs may have: different reinforcement patterns, prestressed reinforcement, or specialized layouts. Use this calculator as an estimate, but verify with precast manufacturer specifications. Precast slabs often have standardized reinforcement that may differ from field-cast slabs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about temperature/shrinkage reinforcement?",
      "answer": "Temperature and shrinkage reinforcement is additional rebar to control cracking from temperature changes and concrete shrinkage. It's typically: smaller diameter bars (6-10 mm), wider spacing (300-400 mm), and placed in the top layer. This calculator estimates main reinforcement - temperature/shrinkage reinforcement is calculated separately. Consult structural design for temperature reinforcement requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "The calculator provides accurate estimates based on geometric calculations and standard rebar weights. Accuracy depends on: precise slab measurements, correct spacing and diameter selection, appropriate edge allowance, and realistic waste margin. The estimate is typically within 5-10% of actual needs when inputs are accurate. However, actual rebar requirements depend on structural design, which may differ from estimates. Always add waste margin (5%) for real-world projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about rebar cutting and bending?",
      "answer": "Rebar cutting and bending are handled during installation and don't affect the quantity calculation directly. However: cutting creates waste (accounted for in waste margin), bending may require extra length for bends, and standard bar lengths (typically 12 m) may require cutting. The calculator provides total length needed - actual cutting and bending are part of installation planning. Waste margin accounts for cutting waste."
