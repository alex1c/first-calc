    {
      "question": "What is ROI?",
      "answer": "ROI (Return on Investment) is a financial metric that measures the profitability of an investment. It's calculated as (Return - Cost) / Cost × 100%."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you calculate ROI?",
      "answer": "ROI = ((Return Value - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost) × 100. This gives you the percentage return on your investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a good ROI?",
      "answer": "A good ROI depends on the investment type. For stocks, 7-10% annually is considered good. For business investments, 15-20%+ is often expected. Marketing ROI of 3:1 or higher is typically good."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between ROI and profit?",
      "answer": "Profit is the absolute dollar amount (return - cost). ROI is the percentage return relative to the investment cost, making it easier to compare investments of different sizes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ROI be negative?",
      "answer": "Yes, if your return value is less than your investment cost, ROI will be negative, indicating a loss on the investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ROI used for?",
      "answer": "ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of investments, compare different investment opportunities, measure marketing campaign effectiveness, and make business decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a good marketing ROI?",
      "answer": "A marketing ROI of 3:1 (300%) or higher is generally considered good. This means for every $1 spent, you generate $3 or more in revenue."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you calculate ROI for multiple investments?",
      "answer": "Calculate ROI for each investment separately, then compare the percentages. You can also calculate weighted average ROI for a portfolio."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ROI vs ROE?",
      "answer": "ROI (Return on Investment) measures return relative to total investment. ROE (Return on Equity) measures return relative to shareholder equity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use ROI for long-term investments?",
      "answer": "ROI is useful for any investment period. For long-term investments, consider annualized ROI to compare with other investments on an annual basis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is annualized ROI?",
      "answer": "Annualized ROI adjusts ROI for the investment period, showing what the return would be on an annual basis. Formula: ((1 + ROI)^(1/years) - 1) × 100."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does time affect ROI?",
      "answer": "Time is crucial for ROI. A 50% ROI over 1 year is much better than 50% over 10 years. Always consider the time period when comparing ROIs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ROI in real estate?",
      "answer": "Real estate ROI includes rental income, appreciation, and tax benefits. It's calculated as (Annual Income + Appreciation - Costs) / Investment Cost × 100."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ROI be over 100%?",
      "answer": "Yes, ROI can exceed 100% when your return is more than double your investment. For example, investing $10,000 and getting $30,000 back is 200% ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a bad ROI?",
      "answer": "A bad ROI depends on context. Generally, ROI below 0% means a loss. ROI below inflation rate (2-3%) means your investment isn't keeping up with purchasing power."
