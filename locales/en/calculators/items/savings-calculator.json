	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "What is a savings calculator?",
			"answer": "A savings calculator helps you project how much your savings will grow over time with compound interest. It shows your future balance, total contributions, and interest earned."
		},
		{
			"question": "How does compound interest work?",
			"answer": "Compound interest means you earn interest on both your principal and previously earned interest. The more frequently interest compounds, the faster your savings grow."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a good interest rate for savings?",
			"answer": "Interest rates vary by account type. High-yield savings accounts typically offer 2-5% APY, while traditional savings accounts may offer 0.01-0.5%. Compare rates from different banks."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I save monthly or make lump sum contributions?",
			"answer": "Regular monthly contributions help build savings consistently and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. However, any savings is better than none - start with what you can afford."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the difference between APR and APY?",
			"answer": "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the simple interest rate. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) includes compound interest, giving you the actual return on your savings. APY is typically higher than APR."
		},
		{
			"question": "How often should interest compound?",
			"answer": "More frequent compounding (daily or monthly) results in higher returns than annual compounding. However, the difference is usually small. Focus on finding the highest APY rather than compounding frequency."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I use a savings account or invest my money?",
			"answer": "Savings accounts are best for emergency funds and short-term goals (1-3 years) due to safety and liquidity. Investments are better for long-term goals (5+ years) as they offer higher potential returns."
		},
		{
			"question": "How much should I save each month?",
			"answer": "Financial experts recommend saving 20% of your income, but start with what you can afford. Even $50-100 per month can grow significantly over time with compound interest."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is an emergency fund and how much should I save?",
			"answer": "An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses. Experts recommend 3-6 months of living expenses. Start with a goal of $1,000, then build up to your full emergency fund."
		},
		{
			"question": "Are savings accounts FDIC insured?",
			"answer": "Yes, savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks are protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. This means your money is safe even if the bank fails."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the difference between a savings account and a money market account?",
			"answer": "Money market accounts typically offer higher interest rates and may include check-writing privileges, but often have higher minimum balance requirements. Savings accounts are simpler with lower minimums."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I withdraw money from my savings account anytime?",
			"answer": "Yes, but federal regulations limit certain types of withdrawals to 6 per month. Check with your bank about their specific withdrawal policies and any fees."
		},
		{
			"question": "How do I maximize my savings growth?",
			"answer": "Maximize growth by: finding the highest APY, making regular contributions, avoiding withdrawals, and letting compound interest work over time. Consider automatic transfers to build savings consistently."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
			"answer": "Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest from previous periods, resulting in exponential growth over time. Compound interest typically yields significantly higher returns than simple interest."
		},
		{
			"question": "Which is better: simple or compound interest?",
			"answer": "Compound interest is almost always better for savings and investments because it grows your money faster. Simple interest is typically used for short-term loans or bonds. For long-term savings, compound interest can make a substantial difference in your final balance."
		},
		{
			"question": "How much more do I earn with compound interest vs simple interest?",
			"answer": "The difference depends on your interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency. Generally, compound interest can yield 20-50% more than simple interest over 10-20 years. The longer the time period and higher the rate, the greater the difference."
