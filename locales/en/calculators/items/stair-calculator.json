  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is comfortable stair height?",
      "answer": "Comfortable riser height ranges from 150-190 mm (6-7.5 inches) for residential stairs. Optimal riser height is typically 170-180 mm (6.7-7.1 inches). Lower risers (150-160 mm) are more comfortable but require more steps and space. Higher risers (180-190 mm) are more compact but may feel steeper. The comfort rule states: 2 × riser + tread should be 600-640 mm for optimal comfort. Always check local building codes for maximum riser height requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many steps is normal?",
      "answer": "The number of steps depends on total height and riser height. For typical residential stairs: Floor-to-floor height 2.4-2.7 m: 13-16 steps. Floor-to-floor height 2.7-3.0 m: 16-18 steps. Floor-to-floor height 3.0-3.3 m: 18-20 steps. The calculator determines the optimal number based on your total height and preferred riser. More steps mean lower risers (more comfortable) but longer horizontal run (more space needed)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why stair angle matters?",
      "answer": "Stair angle affects comfort and safety: Comfortable angle: 30-35° (easy to climb, less tiring). Moderate angle: 35-40° (acceptable, slightly steeper). Steep angle: 40-45° (more difficult, may require handrails). Very steep: >45° (ladder-like, not recommended for regular use). The angle is calculated from riser and tread: angle = arctan(riser / tread). Steeper angles save space but are less comfortable. The calculator shows the angle so you can assess comfort level."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this be used outdoors?",
      "answer": "Yes, this calculator works for outdoor stairs, but consider: Outdoor stairs may need different dimensions (wider treads for safety), weather resistance (non-slip surfaces), and code requirements (may differ from indoor). The calculation method is the same, but you may want to adjust preferred riser/tread for outdoor conditions. Typical outdoor stairs use: risers 150-170 mm, treads 300-350 mm (wider for safety). Always check local codes for outdoor stair requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this calculator code-compliant?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides estimates based on comfort rules and typical dimensions. Building codes vary by location and may specify: Maximum riser height (typically 190-200 mm), minimum tread depth (typically 250-280 mm), maximum variation between risers (typically ±5 mm), and other safety requirements. Always consult local building codes and a qualified professional for code-compliant stair design. This calculator helps with initial planning but is not a substitute for code compliance verification."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the comfort rule?",
      "answer": "The comfort rule states: 2 × riser + tread should equal 600-640 mm (24-25 inches). This formula ensures comfortable step proportions. For example: 2 × 170 mm + 270 mm = 610 mm (optimal). Values below 600 mm indicate stairs are too steep. Values above 640 mm indicate stairs are too shallow. The calculator automatically checks this rule and indicates if your dimensions are optimal, too steep, or too shallow."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure total height?",
      "answer": "Measure total height from the finished floor level of the lower floor to the finished floor level of the upper floor. Include: Floor thickness, subfloor, and any floor coverings. Measure at multiple points to account for floor level variations. Use a level or laser level for accuracy. The measurement should be vertical (not along the stair path). For accuracy, measure from your construction drawings if available."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about landing requirements?",
      "answer": "Landings are required by building codes for: Long stair runs (typically every 12-15 steps), changes in direction, and at door openings. Landings don't affect the step calculation but add to total horizontal space needed. This calculator focuses on the stair run itself - add landing space separately. Typical landing depth: 900-1200 mm (3-4 feet). Always check local building codes for landing requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I adjust riser and tread after calculation?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can adjust preferred riser and tread values and recalculate. The calculator will: Recalculate number of steps based on new riser, adjust actual riser to match total height, and reassess comfort level. Experiment with different values to find the best balance between comfort and space. Remember: Lower risers = more steps = longer run, Higher risers = fewer steps = shorter run but steeper."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about spiral stairs?",
      "answer": "This calculator is designed for straight stairs. Spiral stairs have different requirements: Tread width varies (wider at outside, narrower at inside), riser height may vary, and calculations are more complex. For spiral stairs, consult specialized calculators or a structural engineer. This calculator works best for straight or L-shaped stairs with uniform risers and treads."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "The calculator provides accurate estimates based on geometric calculations and comfort rules. Accuracy depends on: Precise total height measurement, realistic preferred riser/tread values, and proper unit selection. The calculations are mathematically correct, but actual construction may require adjustments for: Floor level variations, structural requirements, and code compliance. Always verify with a qualified professional before construction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about handrails and guardrails?",
      "answer": "Handrails and guardrails are required by building codes but don't affect step calculations. Requirements typically include: Handrail height: 900-1000 mm (34-38 inches), guardrail height: 1000-1100 mm (38-43 inches), and spacing between balusters. This calculator focuses on step dimensions - add handrail/guardrail space separately. Always check local building codes for specific requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for commercial stairs?",
      "answer": "Yes, but commercial stairs may have different requirements: Wider treads (typically 300+ mm), lower risers (typically 150-170 mm), and stricter code requirements. The calculation method is the same, but adjust preferred riser/tread for commercial standards. Commercial stairs prioritize safety and accessibility, so they're typically more gradual (lower riser, wider tread) than residential stairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my calculated riser doesn't match preferred?",
      "answer": "The actual riser may differ from preferred due to rounding. For example: Total height 2.7 m, preferred riser 170 mm → 16 steps, actual riser 168.75 mm. This is normal and ensures the total height is exactly met. The difference is usually small (5-10 mm) and acceptable. If the difference is too large, adjust preferred riser or use max steps constraint to limit the number of steps."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I account for floor coverings?",
      "answer": "Floor coverings (carpet, tile, etc.) affect final riser height. To account for this: Measure total height before floor coverings, calculate stairs, then adjust if needed after floor coverings are installed. Or: Estimate floor covering thickness and add to total height before calculating. Typical floor coverings add 5-15 mm. The calculator uses total height as input - include floor covering thickness in your measurement if you want final dimensions to account for them."
