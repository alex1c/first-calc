	"faq": [
		{
			"question": "How long do tires last?",
			"answer": "Tire lifespan varies by type, quality, driving habits, and conditions. Typical all-season tires: 40,000-60,000 miles. Premium tires: 60,000-80,000+ miles. Budget tires: 30,000-40,000 miles. High-performance tires: 20,000-40,000 miles (shorter due to softer compound). Check your tire's warranty or UTQG rating for expected lifespan."
		},
		{
			"question": "Are premium tires worth it?",
			"answer": "Premium tires often have longer lifespan, better performance (grip, handling, braking), better fuel economy, and better warranty. While they cost more upfront, they may have similar or lower cost per mile due to longer lifespan. They also provide better safety and driving experience. Consider your driving needs and budget."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is cost per mile and why does it matter?",
			"answer": "Cost per mile shows how much tires add to every mile you drive. It helps compare different tire options on an equal basis. For example, a $60 tire that lasts 30,000 miles costs $0.008 per mile, while a $120 tire that lasts 60,000 miles also costs $0.008 per mile - same cost per mile despite double the price. This helps you make informed decisions."
		},
		{
			"question": "Does driving style matter?",
			"answer": "Yes! Aggressive driving (hard acceleration, braking, cornering) wears tires faster. Smooth driving extends tire life. Other factors: proper inflation (underinflation wears tires faster), alignment (misalignment causes uneven wear), road conditions (rough roads wear tires faster), and climate (extreme heat or cold affects tire life)."
		},
		{
			"question": "Should I get seasonal tires?",
			"answer": "Seasonal tires (separate summer and winter sets) provide better performance in their respective seasons. Winter tires offer superior traction in snow/ice. Summer tires offer better handling in warm weather. However, you need two sets, which doubles upfront cost. All-season tires are a compromise that work year-round but aren't optimal in extreme conditions."
		},
		{
			"question": "How often should I replace tires?",
			"answer": "Replace tires when tread depth reaches 2/32\" (legal minimum in most states) or when you see signs of wear, damage, or aging. Even with good tread, replace tires that are 6-10 years old (check sidewall date code). Tires degrade over time even if not driven. Check tread depth regularly with a penny test."
		},
		{
			"question": "What affects tire lifespan?",
			"answer": "Factors affecting tire life: driving habits (aggressive vs smooth), tire maintenance (inflation, rotation, alignment), road conditions, climate, tire quality, vehicle weight, and load. Proper maintenance (regular rotation, correct inflation, alignment) can significantly extend tire life."
		},
		{
			"question": "How much does mounting and balancing cost?",
			"answer": "Mounting and balancing typically costs $15-25 per tire ($60-100 per set of 4). Some shops include it with tire purchase, others charge separately. It's usually done when installing new tires. Some shops offer free rotation and balancing for the life of the tires if purchased there."
		},
		{
			"question": "Do I need to replace all four tires at once?",
			"answer": "Ideally, yes - replace all four tires at once for even wear and consistent performance. However, if only one or two tires are worn, you can replace them in pairs (front or rear). Never replace just one tire unless it matches the others exactly. Mismatched tires can affect handling and safety."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's the difference between tire types?",
			"answer": "All-season: year-round use, compromise performance. Summer: best warm-weather performance, not for cold/snow. Winter: best snow/ice traction, not for warm weather. Performance: high-speed rated, shorter lifespan. Touring: comfort-focused, longer lifespan. Each type has different cost and lifespan characteristics."
		},
		{
			"question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
			"answer": "The calculator provides estimates based on tire price, expected lifespan, and your mileage. Actual tire life varies based on driving habits, maintenance, road conditions, and tire quality. Use it as a planning tool and adjust based on your actual experience. Check tire warranties and reviews for more accurate lifespan estimates."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can I reduce tire costs?",
			"answer": "Ways to reduce costs: maintain proper inflation (extends life), rotate tires regularly (even wear), drive smoothly (less wear), choose tires with longer warranties, shop around for best prices, consider tire rebates, and maintain proper alignment. However, don't sacrifice safety for cost - quality tires are important for safety."
