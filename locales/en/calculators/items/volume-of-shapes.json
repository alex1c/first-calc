  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate the volume of a cube?",
      "answer": "To calculate the volume of a cube, use the formula V = a³, where a is the length of one side. Simply enter the side length and the calculator will compute the volume automatically. Since all sides of a cube are equal, you only need one dimension."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the formula for sphere volume?",
      "answer": "The volume of a sphere is calculated as V = (4/3) × π × r³, where r is the radius. Enter the radius value and the calculator will provide the volume in cubic units."
    },
    {
      "question": "How to find cylinder volume?",
      "answer": "Cylinder volume is calculated by multiplying the area of the circular base (π × r²) by the height: V = π × r² × h. Enter both radius and height to get the volume in cubic units."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cone volume formula?",
      "answer": "The volume of a cone is V = (1/3) × π × r² × h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. The formula is one-third of the cylinder volume with the same base and height."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between area and volume?",
      "answer": "Area measures the space inside a 2D shape (square units like cm², m²), while volume measures the space inside a 3D shape (cubic units like cm³, m³). Area is for flat surfaces, volume is for 3D objects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What units should I use?",
      "answer": "You can use any unit of length (cm, m, inches, feet, etc.). The volume will be in cubic units of the same measurement (cm³, m³, in³, ft³, etc.). For example, if you enter dimensions in meters, the volume will be in cubic meters (m³)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate volume in different units?",
      "answer": "The calculator accepts any unit of length. The result will be in cubic units of the same measurement. For example, if you enter dimensions in centimeters, the volume will be in cubic centimeters (cm³)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the calculations?",
      "answer": "The calculator uses standard mathematical formulas with high precision. For shapes involving π (pi), it uses sufficient decimal places to ensure accuracy. Results are rounded to 6 decimal places for display."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I enter negative numbers?",
      "answer": "All dimensions must be positive numbers greater than zero. The calculator will validate inputs and show an error if invalid values are entered. Volume cannot be negative or zero for physical objects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate volume for irregular shapes?",
      "answer": "This calculator handles regular 3D geometric shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone). For irregular shapes, you may need to break them down into regular shapes or use more advanced methods like integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between cylinder and cone volume?",
      "answer": "A cone with the same base radius and height as a cylinder has exactly one-third the volume of the cylinder. This is why the cone formula includes the factor (1/3)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert between different volume units?",
      "answer": "To convert between volume units, you need to know the conversion factor for the corresponding length units cubed. For example, 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³ (since 1 m = 100 cm, and 100³ = 1,000,000)."
