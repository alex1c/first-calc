  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Should I subtract windows and doors?",
      "answer": "Yes, for accurate material estimation (paint, plaster, wallpaper), you should subtract windows and doors to get net wall area. Gross area includes all wall surface, while net area excludes openings. Net area is more accurate for calculating how much material you actually need. However, some contractors add 5-10% extra to net area to account for waste and cutting around edges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Gross vs net wall area?",
      "answer": "Gross wall area is the total wall surface area before subtracting any openings. Net wall area is the area after subtracting doors, windows, and other openings. Gross area is useful for understanding total wall space, while net area is more accurate for material estimation (paint, plaster, wallpaper). The calculator provides both values for your reference."
    },
    {
      "question": "How to measure irregular rooms?",
      "answer": "For irregular rooms (L-shaped, U-shaped, etc.), break the room into rectangular sections. Calculate the wall area for each section separately, then add them together. Alternatively, measure each wall individually using 'Single Wall' mode and add the results. For very complex shapes, consider using 'Multiple Walls' mode and count each wall section separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Include ceiling?",
      "answer": "No, this calculator focuses on wall area only. Ceilings are calculated separately as they typically use different materials (ceiling paint, ceiling tiles) and have different coverage rates. To calculate ceiling area, use the Room Area Calculator or calculate: ceiling area = length × width. Wall area and ceiling area are separate measurements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Area needed for plaster vs paint?",
      "answer": "Both plaster and paint use the same wall area measurement (net area after subtracting openings). However, plaster typically requires more material per square meter due to thickness (plaster is applied in layers, typically 10-15 mm thick). Paint coverage depends on paint type and number of coats. Use the net wall area from this calculator, then consult material-specific calculators (Paint Calculator, Plaster Calculator) for actual material quantities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure wall height?",
      "answer": "Measure wall height from the floor to the ceiling. For standard rooms, this is typically 2.4-2.7 meters (8-9 feet). If you have baseboards or crown molding, you can include them in the wall height measurement, or calculate them separately. The calculator uses the height you provide - measure consistently for all walls in a room."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about baseboards and crown molding?",
      "answer": "Baseboards and crown molding are typically calculated separately from wall area. They have different material requirements (wood, MDF, etc.) and are measured by linear length rather than area. Wall area is for the main wall surface (paint, plaster, wallpaper). If you want to include baseboards in wall area, add their height to the wall height measurement, but this is not standard practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for exterior walls?",
      "answer": "Yes, this calculator works for both interior and exterior walls. For exterior walls, measure the outside dimensions. Exterior walls may have different finishing requirements (exterior paint, siding, insulation) but the area calculation method is the same. Remember that exterior walls are typically thicker than interior walls, but this doesn't affect surface area calculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "answer": "The calculator provides accurate area estimates based on geometric formulas. Accuracy depends on precise measurement of dimensions. The formulas are mathematically correct, but actual material needs may vary slightly due to: wall irregularities, waste during cutting, and material-specific coverage rates. Always add a small margin (5-10%) for waste when ordering materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if walls have different heights?",
      "answer": "If walls in a room have different heights (e.g., sloped ceilings, partial walls), calculate each wall separately using 'Single Wall' mode and add the results. Or use 'Multiple Walls' mode if you have multiple walls with the same dimensions. The calculator assumes uniform height within each calculation mode - for varying heights, calculate separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert between units?",
      "answer": "The calculator automatically handles unit conversion: 1 m = 3.28084 ft, or 1 ft = 0.3048 m. For area: 1 m² = 10.764 ft², or 1 ft² = 0.0929 m². Simply select your preferred unit system (meters or feet) and enter dimensions in that unit. The calculator will provide results in the same unit system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about wall openings like arches?",
      "answer": "For standard rectangular openings (doors, windows), use the calculator's openings feature. For irregular openings (arches, circular windows), you can approximate them as rectangles or calculate their area separately and subtract manually. The calculator handles rectangular openings automatically - for complex shapes, calculate the opening area separately and subtract from gross area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to account for wall texture?",
      "answer": "Wall texture (smooth, textured, rough) doesn't affect the area calculation, but it may affect material coverage. Rough or heavily textured walls may require more paint or plaster per square meter due to increased surface area. Use the net wall area from this calculator, then adjust material quantities based on wall texture when using material-specific calculators (Paint Calculator, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about corners and edges?",
      "answer": "Corners and edges are included in the wall area calculation. The calculator measures the full wall surface, including corners. For material estimation, you may need slightly more material for corners and edges due to cutting and waste, but the area calculation already includes these surfaces. Add 5-10% extra material for waste and cutting around corners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I calculate multiple rooms?",
      "answer": "Yes, calculate each room separately using 'Room (4 Walls)' mode, then add the net areas together. Or use 'Multiple Walls' mode if you have multiple walls with the same dimensions. The calculator handles one calculation at a time - for multiple rooms, calculate each room's wall area separately and sum them for total material requirements."
